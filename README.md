# Advent of Code (AoC)

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

The [r/adventofcode](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/) subreddit exists with solution megathreads to view the amazing range of solutions and visualisations to the problems.
